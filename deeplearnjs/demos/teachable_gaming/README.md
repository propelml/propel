# Teachable Gaming

The Teachable Gaming demo is inspired by
[Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/).
With it, you train a
[KNN image classifier](https://github.com/PAIR-code/deeplearnjs/blob/master/models/knn_image_classifier/knn_image_classifier.ts)
to perform keyboard keystrokes, which in turn controls video games provided by
[js-dos](https://js-dos.com).
