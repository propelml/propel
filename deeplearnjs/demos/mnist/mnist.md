# Port TensorFlow models
This tutorial demonstrates training and porting a TensorFlow model to **deeplearn.js**.
The code and all the necessary resources used in this tutorial are stored in
`demos/mnist`.

We will use a fully connected neural network that predicts hand-written digits
from the MNIST dataset. The code is forked from the official
[TensorFlow MNIST tutorial](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/r1.2/tensorflow/examples/tutorials/mnist/fully_connected_feed.py).

> NOTE: We will refer to the base directory of the **deeplearn.js** repo as `$BASE`.

First, we clone the **deeplearn.js** repository and make sure we have TensorFlow
installed. We cd into `$BASE` and train the model by running:

```bash
python demos/mnist/fully_connected_feed.py
```

The training should take ~1 minute and will store a model checkpoint in
`/tmp/tensorflow/mnist/tensorflow/mnist/logs/fully_connected_feed/`.

Next, we need to port the weights from the TensorFlow checkpoint to **deeplearn.js**.
We provide a script that does this. We run it from the `$BASE` directory:

```bash
python scripts/dump_checkpoints/dump_checkpoint_vars.py --model_type=tensorflow --output_dir=demos/mnist/ --checkpoint_file=/tmp/tensorflow/mnist/logs/fully_connected_feed/model.ckpt-1999
```

The script will save a set of files (one file per variable, and a
`manifest.json`) in the `demos/mnist` directory. The `manifest.json` is a simple
dictionary that maps variable names to files and their shapes:

```json
{
  ...,
  "hidden1/weights": {
    "filename": "hidden1_weights",
    "shape": [784, 128]
  },
  ...
}
```

One last thing before we start coding - we need to run a static HTTP server from
the `$BASE` directory:

```bash
npm run prep
./node_modules/.bin/http-server
>> Starting up http-server, serving ./
>> Available on:
>>   http://127.0.0.1:8080
>> Hit CTRL-C to stop the server
```

Make sure you can access `manifest.json` via HTTP by visiting
`http://localhost:8080/demos/mnist/manifest.json` in the browser.

We are ready to write some **deeplearn.js** code!

> NOTE: If you choose to write in TypeScript,
make sure you compile the code to JavaScript and serve it via the static HTTP
server.


To read the weights, we need to create a `CheckpointLoader` and point it to the
manifest file. We then call `loader.getAllVariables()` which returns a
dictionary that maps variable names to `NDArray`s. At that point, we are ready
to write our model. Here is a snippet demonstrating the use of
`CheckpointLoader`:

```ts
import {CheckpointLoader} from 'deeplearn';
// manifest.json is in the same dir as index.html.
const varLoader = new CheckpointLoader('.');
varLoader.getAllVariables().then(async vars => {
  const math = new NDArrayMathGPU();

  // Write your model here.
  const hidden1 =
      math.relu(math.add(math.vectorTimesMatrix(..., hidden1W), hidden1B)) as
      Array1D;
  const hidden2 =
      math.relu(math.add(
          math.vectorTimesMatrix(hidden1, hidden2W), hidden2B)) as Array1D;

  const logits = math.add(math.vectorTimesMatrix(hidden2, softmaxW), softmaxB);

  const label = math.argMax(logits);

  console.log('Predicted label: ', await label.data());
});
```

For details regarding the full model code see `demos/mnist/mnist.ts`. The demo
provides the exact implementation of the MNIST model using 3 different API:

- `buildModelMathAPI()` uses the Math API. This is the API in
**deeplearn.js** giving the most control to the user. Math commands execute immediately,
like numpy.

To run the mnist demo, we provide a `watch-demo` script that watches and
recompiles the typescript code when it changes. In addition, the script runs a
simple HTTP server on 8080 that serves the static html/js files. Before you run
`watch-demo`, make sure you kill the HTTP server we started earlier in the
tutorial in order to free up the 8080 port. Then run `watch-demo` from `$BASE`
pointed to the demo dir, `demos/mnist`:

```bash
./scripts/watch-demo demos/mnist
>> Starting up http-server, serving ./
>> Available on:
>>   http://127.0.0.1:8080
>>   http://192.168.1.5:8080
>> Hit CTRL-C to stop the server
>> 1410084 bytes written to demos/mnist/bundle.js (0.91 seconds) at 5:17:45 PM
```

Visit `http://localhost:8080/demos/mnist/` and you should see a simple page
showing test accuracy of ~90% measured using a test set of 50 mnist images
stored in `demos/mnist/sample_data.json`. Feel free to play with the demo
(e.g. make it interactive) and send us a pull request!
