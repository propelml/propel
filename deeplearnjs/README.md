# Getting started

**deeplearn.js** is an open source hardware-accelerated JavaScript library for
machine intelligence. **deeplearn.js** brings performant machine learning
building blocks to the web, allowing you to train neural networks in a browser
or run pre-trained models in inference mode.

We provide two APIs, an immediate execution model (think NumPy) and a deferred
execution model mirroring the TensorFlow API.
**deeplearn.js** was originally developed by the Google Brain PAIR team to build
powerful interactive machine learning tools for the browser, but it can be used
for everything from education, to model understanding, to art projects.

## Usage

```
npm install deeplearn
```

#### TypeScript / ES6 JavaScript
See the [TypeScript starter project](https://github.com/PAIR-code/deeplearnjs/tree/master/starter/typescript/) and the
[ES6 starter project](https://github.com/PAIR-code/deeplearnjs/tree/master/starter/es6/) to get you quickly started. They contain a
short example that sums an array with a scalar (broadcasted):

```ts
import {Array1D, NDArrayMathGPU, Scalar} from 'deeplearn';

const math = new NDArrayMathGPU();
const a = Array1D.new([1, 2, 3]);
const b = Scalar.new(2);

const result = math.add(a, b);

// Option 1: With async/await.
// Caveat: in non-Chrome browsers you need to put this in an async function.
console.log(await result.data());  // Float32Array([3, 4, 5])

// Option 2: With a Promise.
result.data().then(data => console.log(data));

// Option 3: Synchronous download of data.
// This is simpler, but blocks the UI until the GPU is done.
console.log(result.dataSync());
```

#### ES3/ES5 JavaScript

You can also use **deeplearn.js** with plain JavaScript. Load the latest version
of the library from [unpkg](https://unpkg.com):

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/deeplearn"></script>
```

To use a specific version, add `@version` to the unpkg URL above
(e.g. `https://unpkg.com/deeplearn@0.2.0`), which you can find in the
[releases](https://github.com/PAIR-code/deeplearnjs/releases) page on GitHub.
After importing the library, the API will be available as `dl` in the global
namespace.

```js
var math = new dl.NDArrayMathGPU();
var a = dl.Array1D.new([1, 2, 3]);
var b = dl.Scalar.new(2);

var result = math.add(a, b);

// Option 1: With a Promise.
result.data().then(data => console.log(data)); // Float32Array([3, 4, 5])

// Option 2: Synchronous download of data. This is simpler, but blocks the UI.
console.log(result.dataSync());
```


## Development

To build **deeplearn.js** from source, we need to clone the project and prepare
the dev environment:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/PAIR-code/deeplearnjs.git
$ cd deeplearnjs
$ npm run prep # Installs node modules and bower components.
```

We recommend using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for
development. Make sure to install [TSLint VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eg2.tslint) and the `clang-format` command line tool with the [Clang-Format VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=xaver.clang-format) for auto-formatting.

To interactively develop any of the demos (e.g. `demos/nn-art/`):

```bash
$ ./scripts/watch-demo demos/nn-art
>> Starting up http-server, serving ./
>> Available on:
>>   http://127.0.0.1:8080
>> Hit CTRL-C to stop the server
>> 1357589 bytes written to dist/demos/nn-art/bundle.js (0.85 seconds) at 10:34:45 AM
```

Then visit `http://localhost:8080/demos/nn-art/`. The
`watch-demo` script monitors for changes of typescript code and does
incremental compilation (~200-400ms), so users can have a fast edit-refresh
cycle when developing apps.

Before submitting a pull request, make sure the code passes all the tests and is clean of lint errors:

```bash
$ npm run test
$ npm run lint
```

To run a subset of tests and/or on a specific browser (note the extra `--`):

```bash
$ npm run test -- --browsers=Chrome --grep='multinomial'
Â 
> ...
> Chrome 62.0.3202 (Mac OS X 10.12.6): Executed 28 of 1891 (skipped 1863) SUCCESS (6.914 secs / 0.634 secs)
```

To build a standalone ES5 library that can be imported in the browser with a
`<script>` tag:

```bash
$ ./scripts/build-standalone.sh # Builds standalone library.
>> Stored standalone library at dist/deeplearn(.min).js
```

To do a dry run and test building an npm package:

```bash
$ ./scripts/build-npm.sh
>> Stored npm package at dist/deeplearn-VERSION.tgz
```

To install it locally, run `npm install ./dist/deeplearn-VERSION.tgz`.

> On Windows, use bash (available through git) to use the scripts above.

[issues](https://github.com/PAIR-code/deeplearnjs/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22).

## Supported environments

**deeplearn.js** targets environments with WebGL 1.0 or WebGL 2.0. For devices
without the `OES_texture_float` extension, we fall back to fixed precision
floats backed by a `gl.UNSIGNED_BYTE` texture. For platforms without WebGL,
we provide CPU fallbacks.

While the library supports most devices, our demos don't currently work on
iOS Mobile or Desktop Safari. We are working on updating them, check back soon.
